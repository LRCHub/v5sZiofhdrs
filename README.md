# 松本孝弘 – #1090 ～Thousand Dreams～

```
I had just stepped out of my high school shoes
Wondering what a guy like me is supposed to do
In the hustle and the bustle of the status quo
All the beggars seem to knock at my door
All I can see, they're needing for
Hey, you know him, his name is Matsumoto and
He's jamming on the guitar

Where do we go?
1090
We have to go
1090

I'm a slave to the world
Such a tiresome trick, hanging at the guitar shop
Seem to lick the quick, and maybe half of the world
Would like to be in my place
Surrounded by guitars, I'm in this inner space
And to be a star, that wouldn't be so bad
Well, a spoon full of that
If even only I had to make a single impression

Where do we go?
1090
We have to go
1090

Where do we go?
1090
We have to go
1090

On every face, until it comes back around
When we're rocking the place, now, which will you choose?
But if you're like me, all you have to do
Is raise your guitar 1090 to the sky

Where do we go?
1090
We have to go
1090

Where do we go?
1090
We have to go
1090

Where do we go?
1090
We have to go
1090
